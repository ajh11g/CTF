> I got this e-mail from my colleague:
"Hi, Tom! I know you are busy programming your S7 PLC, but you have to watch this movie Rubber! It's perfect!Â https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1WSD_cnRbA"

# Writeup
I used the hint for this task, which was "Why are you watching this video?". The only speaking character in the video repeats the phrase "No reason".
